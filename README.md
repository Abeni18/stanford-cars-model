##1. Dependency
- PyTorch
- scikit-image
- opencv-python

##2. Extract training & testing data using annotation bounding box

First navigate the data_processing folder and create following folder structure
data_processing --- datasets --- train --- original
                            |         |--- extracted
                            |
                            |--- test --- original
                                    |--- extracted

cd data_processing
mkdir datasets
cd datasets
mkdir train test
